TypeScript Learning Journey

I started with an intensive immersion into the basics of TypeScript. I have written and documented the fundamentals of the language and set up the development environment to ensure everything works smoothly.

After covering the basics, I created several examples to explore the various methods and functionalities available in TypeScript. Next, I will tackle challenges from Codewars as practical exercises to reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned.

Stay tuned for more updates as I progress through this learning journey!
